				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Something I learned about this article is that designers and business associates create decieving user interfaces to manipulate users.
							These practices are not mistakes but rather are carefully created with an actual intent to decieve. I also learned that there several different types of dark patterns, some of which are always present in every day life.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was reading about the different types of dark patterns. Particularly, the roach motel one which entails the subscription example. 
							I have always found it difficult to unsubcribe as usually pressing the unsubscribe button only once would not work or it would be hard to even find the button.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "dark pattern is a misleading or otherwise deceptive UI/UX decision that tries to exploit human psychology to get users to do things they don't really want to do." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
