					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned is that typography is related to purpose.
								 This is because it's targeted to influence the audience to continue on the page or grab their attention on a particular item.
								A poor design can make the audience confused, not interested or can even lead to misinformation.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the color section.
								 This is because apart from font size or styles, I think colors and color constrast has a big influence on the audience's attention span.
								For instance, I think warm, minimal colors on a webpage help the audience stay focus on the actual content rather than the design of the page.</p>
