							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think this article does a solid job in showing how human processing works and how UX designers can center their designs around it.
								 It did not influence my opinion other than just being conscious of ways user's attention are caught. 
								 I found the cocktail party effect interesting as no matter how many items there are, the eyes get attracted and just focus on one thing.
								  Another example I found interesting is the sustained attention topic in which designers need to take into account the duration of the user's attention span.</p>
