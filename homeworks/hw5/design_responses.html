                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article are the different styles of interfaces. 
                                Even though they all were similar in that they were animated interfaces,their design set them apart.
                                It was nice to see that the purpose of the animation was made known even though it was seconds worth.  </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was viewing the previews of the interfaces. 
                                Each individual animation highlighted their main functions in a few seconds. 
                                It was interesting to see the variation of sectors embedded into the designs. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite animation was the shazam style shopping.
                                This is because it gave you information about the jacket the model was wearing as well as other similar designs. 
                                I think this may be useful when you see something on a social media platform and are interested in an outfit that you saw on someone.
                                I think the interfaces achieves its goal by having a simple design in where the clothing options are the ones that take the space of the page.
                                It seems like it is easy to navigate without useless features.  </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> I give this a 7 because, although it was interesting, I felt it would have been better with a small written description of 1-2 sentences. </p>
