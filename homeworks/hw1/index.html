    <li> Something I learned is to be an analyzer instead of simply a user. 
        This implies thinking about the intent of a certain application and reasons behind features. </li>
    <li> My favorite part of the article was the breakdown of twitter.
         It was interesting to read that there is clear intention behind bolding of numbers and the choice of words. </li>
    <li> Quote I found compelling: "be curious about everything you see and think through the choices that had to be made for this product."</li>
    <li> Score: 8</li>
